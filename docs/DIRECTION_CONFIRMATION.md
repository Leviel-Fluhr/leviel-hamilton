# ✅ Direction Confirmation

## Is This a Good Direction?

**YES - This is EXCELLENT!** Here's why it aligns with the interview guidelines:

### ✅ Matches Interview Evaluation Criteria

1. **Analytical Thinking** ✅
   - You identified a clear pattern (2 populations)
   - You're forming a hypothesis (what features separate them?)
   - You want to validate findings (tests and visualizations)

2. **AI Collaboration** ✅
   - You're guiding the biological direction
   - I'm implementing the technical analysis
   - We're working together to explore the question

3. **Communication** ✅
   - Clear objectives (understand population separation)
   - Structured approach (organized folders, step-by-step)
   - Will document findings

### ✅ Follows Best Practices

1. **Build Incrementally** ✅
   - Started with exploration (done)
   - Now focused analysis (population separation)
   - Will validate and document

2. **Hamilton DAG Pattern** ✅
   - Each analysis step = Hamilton node
   - Clear dependencies and data flow
   - Modular and reusable

3. **Workspace Standards** ✅
   - Organized output structure
   - Using workspace utilities
   - Following coding conventions

## What We're Building

### Output Structure
```
output/
├── exploratory/              # Initial exploration (PCA, correlation, etc.)
├── population_analysis/     # Population separation analysis
│   ├── differential_expression/
│   ├── feature_importance/
│   └── statistical_tests/
└── visualizations/           # All plots organized by analysis type
```

### Analysis Plan

1. **Population Assignment** - Classify samples into Population 1 vs Population 2
2. **Differential Expression** - Find genes that differ between populations
3. **Feature Importance** - Rank genes by separation power
4. **Statistical Tests** - Validate differences
5. **Visualizations** - Show separation clearly

This is a **perfect next step** for the interview exercise!
