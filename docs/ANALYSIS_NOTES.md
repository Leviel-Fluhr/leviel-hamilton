## Biologically Relevant Questions to Consider

### RNA-seq Dataset (Biological Focus)

**Potential Questions:**
1. **ADC vs Free Drug Comparison**
   - Do ADCs (Enhertu, Trodelvy, PADCEV) show different gene expression patterns than free drugs?
   - Biological relevance: ADCs have targeted delivery, free drugs are systemic
   
2. **Concentration-Response Relationships**
   - Which genes show dose-dependent responses?
   - Biological relevance: Identifies sensitive pathways and mechanisms
   
3. **Compound-Specific Signatures**
   - Do different ADCs target different pathways?
   - Biological relevance: Mechanism of action differences
   
4. **Control vs Treatment**
   - What genes are differentially expressed in treatments vs controls?
   - Biological relevance: Treatment effects vs baseline

### Diabetes Dataset (Clinical Focus)

**Potential Questions:**
1. **Readmission Risk Factors**
   - What clinical factors predict <30 day readmission?
   - Clinical relevance: Patient care optimization
   
2. **Medication Impact**
   - Which medications are associated with readmission?
   - Clinical relevance: Treatment optimization
